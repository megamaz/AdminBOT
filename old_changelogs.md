2.1.2020
Update! Wowie!
This is the first changelog in AdminBOT. Nothing to be excited about.

++ADDITIONS++
Not too many things. 
1.This might not come as a surprise but hey... `>changelog`
This is a new command. Simply put, whenever there is an update, you will get this. Expect it'll contain the new stuff.

---BUG FIXES---
1. AdminBOT's failsafe has been getting triggered by some bots, for some reason. (Issue 20) (You can check out the entire issue list on my support server: https://discord.gg/z76mn4r)
Instead of fixing the bug, I simply removed the failsafe message and instead a simple reaction will do.
2. AdminBOT will no longer delete your message after censoring a word. This makes it much easier.

--REMOVAL--
_[waddya know there's nothing here]_

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.4.20 - 2.5.20

Another one??

Yes. Another update. This one is for __Creator contact!__
You can now __directly contact me__ by DMing AdminBOT. 
For a response, you will have to join my support server however. (link:https://discord.gg/z76mn4r)
I can also directly friend you if you'd like a response. _FYI, creator is `megamaz#4961`. If this shows up and you asked a question, don't deny it!_

--ADDITIONS--
1. DMing AdminBOT will now send a message to the creator!
This is the main update. For more info, read above.

--UPDATES--
1. Editing a message and adding a swear word will now allow AdminBOT to catch one.
Nice try you little sneak
2. AdminBOT's status will now contain a little nudge for you to know you can DM it. 

SIDE NOTE
AdminBOT's power outage that lasted a while is now over. Hopefully everything will work as intended. Do report any problems by either Dming AdminBOT or joining my support server. (https://discord.gg/z76mn4r)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[RELEASE DATE]
DM update

This is supposed to be a big one.
Well, I hope it is. Here's all you need to know;
If it gets too long, just an FYI that I have to stick to 2000 characters.

--ADDITIONS--
1. DM commands
There are now commands built-in DM! Use `>help DM` to see the commands.

--UPDATES--
1. `>failsafe` command now functions like the actual failsafe and react to the message.
2. `>censor` command deletes the message
4. `>cenored` will no longer publicly show words, instead they will be DM'ed

--BUG FIXES--
1. `>uptime` command displays hour properly (issue 18)


SIDE NOTE:
Most of the update is focused around DM's. There are some changes made that are not DM related.
Issue 20 is still being fixed. The error hasn't showed up. I do not know what was causing it - it might still show up.

5.25.2020 *For announcements and more info on updates, join the Support Server: https://discord.gg/z76mn4r*
Update 5.25.2020 V1.5
I wanted this update to be a rather bigger one compared to the older ones. I finally got the stupid 18th issue working and fixed, which means the uptime will be more accurate. I made the bot a tad bit more useful as well, so that's that. Here's the changelog for y'all


--ADDITIONS--
- AdminBOT will now respond to non-admin users trying to use admin commands.
- `>feedback` will provide you with a link to the feedback page
- `>join [channel ID]` will send a message for every user that joins inside the specified channel

--UPDATES--
- Remember how I said there would never be detection between spaces (W O R D)? I lied. Cheers!
- `>failsafe` will now give info on the failsafe. Not just trigger a fake one.
- Censoring mechanism will ignore Admins (get your anger out there)
- AdminBOT's censoring message will be deleted after 30 seconds. This it to take less space.

--BUG FIXES--
- Issue #18: Uptime not displaying hours properly.
